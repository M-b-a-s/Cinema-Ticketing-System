# Cinema-Ticketing-System
---
## Description:
This project is a simple console-based Cinema Ticketing System implemented in C. It allows customers to enter a cinema, segregates customers below the age of 18 into a "Kids Zone," and allows customers 18 and above to order popcorn, drinks, and small chops. After completing their orders, customers will be issued a ticket with a seat number.

## Project Features:

1. **User Entry:**
   - The program prompts the user to enter their age.
   - If the user is below 18, they are directed to the Kids Zone.
   - If the user is 18 or older, they can proceed to order snacks.

2. **Ordering System:**
   - Customers can choose from a menu of available items (popcorn, drinks, small chops).
   - They can specify quantities of each item.
   - The program calculates the total cost of the order.

3. **Ticket Generation:**
   - A ticket is generated for the customer.
   - The ticket includes a unique ticket number and a randomly assigned seat number.
   - The ticket details are displayed to the customer.
